This repository contains smart contract that allows you to store medical machine learning content, while ensuring its integrity through IPFS hashes. Each smart contract corresponds to a specific part of machine learning content, which provides easy composition and imitation from each other.

Can be deployed right away in Ethereum network. But with current Ethereum prices deploying this smart contract in main Ethereum network is not recommended due to high price of operations in main network. Also, keep in mind that this project is still in process of development, so for now versioning is not applied and changes could be done in any time.

This work is inspired and based on article [Combating Deepfake Videos Using Blockchain and Smart Contracts](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8668407)

Below you can see proposed scheme for working with this smart contract:

This smart contract was tested in Remix IDE with test data.
